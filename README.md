This project analyzes the performance of different cipher suites supported in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 protocol when used in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs have resource constraints like limited computing power, memory, and battery life. This project evaluates how the computationally lightweight cipher suites in TLS 1.3 designed for better security and performance fare in WSN environments.

The project uses network simulation tools like NS-3 to simulate WSNs and deploy TLS 1.3 cipher suites. Performance metrics like throughput, latency, encryption/decryption overhead are measured. The results are compared to form a baseline to evaluate deprecated TLS cipher suites. The goal is to determine the factors affecting TLS 1.3 cipher suite performance in WSNs.

Key Outcomes:

Performance analysis of TLS 1.3 cipher suites in WSN environments using NS-3
Baseline measurements of throughput, latency, encryption/decryption overhead
Comparative evaluation with deprecated TLS cipher suites
Identification of factors affecting TLS 1.3 performance in resource-constrained WSNs
Guidelines for optimization and deployment of TLS 1.3 in IoT/WSNs
